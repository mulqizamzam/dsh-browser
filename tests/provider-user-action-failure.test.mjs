// Regression for issue #16: a failed toolbar action must never be able to take
// the whole DSH host down.
//
// Two independent shapes were reported, and both are covered here:
//   1. the provider read the host's method off its owner and called it unbound,
//      so the host ran with `this === undefined` and threw at its first statement
//      (`void this.ready()`);
//   2. even correctly bound, `ready()` threw SYNCHRONOUSLY once the host had been
//      disposed — a synchronous throw escapes a fire-and-forget caller's
//      `.catch`, which is what turned a diagnostics path into a fatal error.
